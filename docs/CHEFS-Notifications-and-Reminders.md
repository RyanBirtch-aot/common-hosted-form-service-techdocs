## Submission Success Confirmation for Team Members

Form owners have the option to set up email notifications for team members whenever a submission is successful. These notifications can be enabled when the form is initially created or later through the form settings. 

Team members' email addresses must be manually added to the appropriate field to receive notifications.

The submitter can invite other team members to collaborate on the form draft. To add members, the submitter should click on the team members icon located in the top right corner after saving the initial draft.

Once the submitter selects a specific identity provider and adds members who will be working on the draft, CHEFS  will send an invitation email with the following content:
